# IT-Project
// Made by group ARK

Dev Intro:

I have made a preliminary skeleton for the app, and now the client-side contains the followings:

-   a main activity that contains a bottom navigation bar and 4 fragments
-   4 fragments: Home, Chat, Map, Profile, their names are self-explanatory

Functionalities needed for each of the 4 fragments:
    Home: do welcoming sort of bullshit
    Chat: can connect to our server(which I will be implementing) and load/send chat messages
    Map: features we discussed last week
    Profile: user info, settings


I recommend each of us clone the client-side from git and give it a run.
